\chapter{Conclusions and discussion}

\newthought{This dissertation examined a class of privacy issues for on-line communication}, proposing a model for the user identity and a possible new approach to information privacy management. This work focused on the analysis of privacy violation that can be found in different scenarios, on web and mobile applications and services.
The goal was to convince the reader that, as the web is shifting towards hypermedia data models and protocols, also privacy analysis and protection have to adopt the same mindset.

Given the extent of privacy issues and violations that are ignored by application developers and service providers, the author believes that the analysis, solutions and results presented in this dissertation provide the basis to understand these and possibly address them.
The author also hopes these results will motivate and provide a solid theoretical basis for additional analysis and privacy management techniques, and, ultimately, have a direct impact over users' privacy by eliminating or reducing barriers to the delopment of new and existing privacy aware protocols and services.
